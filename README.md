# Bird-Counting
A program that counts number of birds in a given image using conventional image processing techniques.

-In this assignment, we are asked to implement a bird counting algorithm from scratch using segmentation methods. We have given three input images to test our program. The number of birds in each image are 10, 3, and 22, respectively. Our aim was to compare our program with the actual result as can be reviewed in section 3. 

-The details of the goose detector algorithm can be found in the [report](https://github.com/Terminou/Bird-Counting/blob/main/report.pdf).
